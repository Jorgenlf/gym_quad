# Path Following and Collision Avoidance for Quadcopters using Deep Reinforcement Learning

This repo implements a 6-DOF simulation model for a quadcopter according to the stable baselines (OpenAI) interface for reinforcement learning control.
## Getting Started

To install all packages needed in your virtual environment, run:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
 
### Training an agent:

All hyperparameters and setup can be tuned in the file [train.py] and [__init__.py].

For training an agent, run:

```
python train3d.py --exp_id [x]
```

Where x is the experiment id number. 


## Running an agent in the environment

For running an agent in any scenario, use:

```
python run3d.py --exp_id [x] --scenario [scenario] --controller_scenario [controller_scenario] --controller [y]
```

Where x is the experiment id number, scenario is what scenario to run, controller_scenario is which scenario the controller was trained in and y is
which agent number to run. If no y is provided, the agent called "last_model.pkl" is chosen. Scenarios can be either of "line", "horizontal" or
"3d".
